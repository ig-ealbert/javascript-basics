# javascript-basics

## Overview

This repository contains a set of walkthroughs about basic programming concepts using JavaScript.  They are meant for beginners with no programming experience.

Each walkthrough will have a markdown (.md) file, a predefined .html file, and a blank .js file.  The markdown file will explain what is set up in the .html file, as well as the concepts and the steps to complete the learning exercise.  The .js file will be where any code is added.

## Prerequisites

Some basic knowledge of HTML would be helpful, but is not required.

The only requirements are a text editor and a modern browser.  I use Notepad++ for my text editor, and Chrome as my browser.

## Contents

1. **Getting Started With JavaScript** - Get familiar with the provided files, and write your first line of JavaScript.  Create a webpage that displays a "hello world" message.

2. **Variables** - Learn how to store and retrieve values.  Create a webpage that multiplies two numbers and displays the result.

3. **If Statements and For Loops** - Learn how to control program flow by conditionally executing code, and running the same commands multiple times.  Create a website that displays all integers from 1 to the specified number.

4. **Functions** - Learn how to group code into reusable blocks.  Create a website that encrypts and decrypts a message.

5. **Recursion** - Learn how to simplify problems until you reach a base case.  This makes seemingly difficult problems easy to solve!  Create a website that computes the factorial of a number.

6. **Arrays** - Learn about arrays.  Create a website that displays pictures of cats.

7. **Objects** - Learn how to model custom data as objects.  Create a website that displays information about different Pokemon.

## Recommended Reference Material

MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) provides web programming documentation.  I like their JavaScript reference material because it is easy to understand and navigate.  If you want to look up methods on a type like `Array` or `String`, choose that object from the left side navigation and you get a list of methods with explanations and details.  It takes a lot of practice to remember even the common built-in methods, so don't be afraid to use MDN.
