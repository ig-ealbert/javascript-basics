# All Together Now

## Overview

In the lessons up until now, we've learned valuable basics.

  * Variables
  * Control Flow
  * Loops
  * Functions
  * Client-Side Specifics
  * Server-Side Specifics

Now it's time to make a real project using what we have learned.

## Try It Out

The goal is to create a webpage where you can display the images (provided) and some statistics based on the Pokemon selected in the dropdown.

Either clone this repository, download the files, or copy the `objects.html` and `objects.js` files and the `images` folder from the `js2017 objects` lesson [here](../js2017/objects).

The `objects.html` file has the starter HTML, as there is no prerequisite to know HTML to do this.  You will not have to edit this file.

The `objects.js` file is blank - this is for you to fill in!  Don't worry, the `objects.md` file contains instructions on what to do if you get lost, or if you'd like a more guided approach.  You can view the instructions as a webpage [here](../js2017/objects/objects.md).

If you're a CSS guru, feel free to add a .css file, link it to the HTML file, and make it prettier!

## Note

The example I created in 2017 uses `var` all over the place.  This is not recommended.  Either `const` (if you don't need to change the value) or `let` (if you do need to change it) are suggested in place of `var`.
